In Python, the code is read line by line, from the top to bottom (**sequence concept**). However, selection can alter the flow of the code based on certain conditions. In this case, the **if** word is used to help select/decide whether or not a particular section of the code is executed. On the other hand, if we seek to repeat a particular section of a code, i.e. repetition, we can employ **for** and **while** loops to carry out this partiular task. In the next few sections, we will be looking at how flow control- selection and repetition can be done in Python. \n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"RVJMzUiRCtAC","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2.1 Basic Concept of If\n","\n","The syntax for a basic if statement is as follows:\n","\n","if condition:\n","> indented statement block\n","\n","If the condition is true, then the indented statement block is ran, otherwise, the entire statement block is ignored.
